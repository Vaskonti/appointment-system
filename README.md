## Approach
- **Users** are the so called "businesses" that can create appointments and assign them to clients.
- **Clients** are the users that can receive appointments and reminders.
- **Appointments** can be created with a specific date, time, timezone, and recurrence.
- **Reminders** are sent to clients based on their preferences (email or SMS) and can be customized.
- **Notifications** are sent using Laravel's notification system, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **Timezone Awareness** ensures that appointments and reminders are sent at the correct local time for each client.
- **Recurrence Support** allows appointments to be set for daily, weekly, or monthly intervals, maximum recurrences and recurrence intervals
- **Notification Preference** allows clients to choose how they want to receive reminders (email or SMS).
- **Testing** is done using Pest, with a focus on API endpoints and business logic as well as unit tests for appointments
